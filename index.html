<p>
In this city, vintage shopping isn't just a means to an end. It's a lifestyle, a mindset, a sport, and, yes, a great way to spend a Saturday.<br>
New Yorkers are well-versed in sifting through the $10 bin. They know when to splurge on the perfect piece for their tightly curated closets.<br>
They often answer "it's from the '60s" whenever someone stops to compliment their floor-length dress. But, don't get jealous.<br>
